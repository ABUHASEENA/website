                FAMILY. I live with both of my parent and I have a really good relationship with them; but my relationship with my mom is very special because we trust each other a lot, we tell each other everything and I know I can count on her anytime. I have two older brothers and even though we fight a lot we get along very well.
                FRIENDS. I knew most of my best friends in my higher school, I really love to be around them, I always have a lot of fun and I think I have a lot of best friends.
